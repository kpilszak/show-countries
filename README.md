## About

Welcome to the "Show Countries" project! 🚀 This web application utilizes AJAX technology to dynamically fetch and display countries' flags. It's a visual journey around the world, right from your browser!

The project relies on the [CountryLayer API](https://countrylayer.com) to retrieve accurate and up-to-date information about countries.

## Technologies

The project is built using the following technologies:
- **JavaScript:** The backbone of the project, enabling dynamic and interactive content.
- **AJAX:** Powering the asynchronous data fetching, allowing seamless updates without refreshing the entire page.

## Usage

To explore the flags of various countries, simply visit the [Show Countries website](https://kpilszak.github.io/show-countries/). Open the link in a new tab, and let the adventure begin!

Feel free to explore and enjoy the visual richness of countries from all corners of the globe.
